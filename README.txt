Welcome to the README for the handy weather station using Arduino Uno, BMP280, DHT11, anemometer, GSM 900A, and solar panel and Li battery for power. 
This README will provide you with the necessary information to assemble and operate your weather station.

Hardware Components
The following is a list of the components needed to assemble the weather station:

Arduino Uno
BMP280 Barometric Pressure and Temperature Sensor
DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
Anemometer Wind Speed Sensor
GSM 900A Module
Solar Panel
Li Battery
Jumper Wires
Breadboard
Assembly
Connect the BMP280 to the Arduino Uno using the following connections:
VCC -> 3.3V
GND -> GND
SCL -> A5
SDA -> A4
Connect the DHT11 to the Arduino Uno using the following connections:
VCC -> 5V
GND -> GND
OUT -> D8
Connect the anemometer to the Arduino Uno using the following connections:
VCC -> 5V
GND -> GND
OUT -> D0
Connect the GSM 900A to the Arduino Uno using the following connections:
VCC -> 5V
GND -> GND
TX -> D2
RX -> D3
RST -> D9
Connect the LCD to the Arduino Uno using the following connections:
GND -> GND
VCC -> 5V
SDA -> A4/A3
SCL -> A5-
Connect the solar panel to the Li battery using the following connections:
Connect the positive (+) terminal of the solar panel to the positive (+) terminal of the Li battery.
Connect the negative (-) terminal of the solar panel to the negative (-) terminal of the Li battery.
Connect the Li battery to the Arduino Uno using the following connections:
Connect the positive (+) terminal of the Li battery to the Vin pin on the Arduino Uno.
Connect the negative (-) terminal of the Li battery to the GND pin on the Arduino Uno.
Place all components on the breadboard and connect them using jumper wires.
Code
Download and install the Arduino IDE from the official website.
Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
Copy and paste the code from the file "handy_weather_station.ino" into the new sketch.
Connect the Arduino Uno to your computer using a USB cable.
Select the correct board and port from the Tools menu.
Click the "Upload" button to upload the code to the Arduino Uno.
Usage
Power on the weather station using the Li battery and solar panel.
Wait a few seconds for the weather station to initialize.
The weather station will begin measuring temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, and wind speed.
The weather station will send this data to your phone via SMS using the GSM 900A module.
The weather station will continue to measure and send data until the Li battery runs out of power or the solar panel is no longer receiving sunlight.
Maintenance
Keep the solar panel clean and free of debris to ensure maximum power output.
Replace the Li battery as needed to ensure uninterrupted power to the weather station.
Test the GSM 900A module periodically to ensure it is functioning properly and can send SMS messages.
Calibrate the sensors as needed to ensure accurate measurements.
